 * @title L2GNS
 * @dev The Graph Name System contract provides a decentralized naming system for subgraphs
 * used in the scope of the Graph Network. It translates Subgraphs into Subgraph Versions.
 * Each version is associated with a Subgraph Deployment. The contract has no knowledge of
 * human-readable names. All human readable names emitted in events.
 * The contract implements a multicall behaviour to support batching multiple calls in a single
 * transaction.
 * This particular contract is meant to be deployed in L2, and includes helper functions to
